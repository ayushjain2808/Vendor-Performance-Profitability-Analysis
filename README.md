## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. 🛠️ Data Ingestion
- Read and load raw vendor sales data using Python
- Store in SQL tables via custom ingestion scripts

### 2. 🧾 Data Modeling & ETL (SQL)
- Structured schema for vendor, sales, and product tables
- SQL queries to extract KPIs: profit margin, order volume, stock turnover

### 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Visualized key patterns in sales, profit, returns, and price bands
- Identified high-revenue and low-performing vendors

### 4. 📈 Dashboarding (Power BI)
- KPI cards: total profit, margin %, vendor count
- Filters: region, product, vendor type
- Charts: bar, pie, stacked area, slicers
- Real-time insights for executives and analysts
